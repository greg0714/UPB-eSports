# UPB-eSports
This is the base for an eSports management system for the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. It includes both the RESTful web service running on Spring Boot for doing basic CRUD operations and a simple client. It also uses OpenID Connect authentication through a Gluu server, which can be changed to another OIDC provider with minor configuration.

This was my Capstone project for completing my undergraduate. It was meant more as an exploration into how to use modern technologies rather than to be an effective management system. At this point in time, the application only handles rosters and scheduling.
